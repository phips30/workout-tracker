### MVP Architecture
To get started quickly, a MVP architecture should contain only the most basic
components required to make the app useful, without yet thinking about
a proper storage or analytics component.
Therefore, the analytics will be fully ignored at the moment, priority is
all about being able to store the data.
Also the NoSQL DB will be replaced initially with a simple CSV file.
